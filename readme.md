 how to store images?
        obv we will use 3rd party service like aws,coudnery
        first user upload the images then we will store the images temporarily on server bcoz if there is some cncntion lost to safe rhay
        some companies direct upload krdeti h

.gitkeep
        note:to git ignore empty folders and doesnt push them as git pushes files and not folder
        so,therefore to maintain the work flow of the file we may sometime need to push those empty folder also
        therefore we make a file .gitkeep(maybe of diff name)
        cd public/temp/
